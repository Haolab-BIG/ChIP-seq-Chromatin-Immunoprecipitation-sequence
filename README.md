# ChIP-seq-Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation-sequence
For everyone who has a new face to HaoLab, we make this pipeline/protocol to standardize downstream analysis pipeline for ChIP-Seq data.
## Part I Workflow
Here stands an throughout workflow of ChIP-seq data analysis.

As illustrated in the figure, \
(i) yellow circles represent the steps where commands need to be entered; \
(ii) gray circles indicate the data types handled at different steps; \
(iii) pink dashed rectangular boxes represent the output results after processing at each step. 

We will proceed by structuring our workflow according to (iii).
